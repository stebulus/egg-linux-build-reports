Build reports for https://github.com/stebulus/egg-linux .

To contribute a build report, download the build-report script
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stebulus/egg-linux-build-reports/master/build-report
If you ran `./hatch x` to build egg-linux, then run
  ./build-report YOURNAME . x report
Then either tar up the `report` directory and email it to me at
steven@amotlpaa.org, or put it in a PR to this repo.

For an example of interpreting the reports here, try
  ./flatten report |awk -f example.awk -v commit=e11acd885d9f5971d2274dc56ee9df469bd9dd48
or (if you have Python)
  python2 example.py report e11acd885d9f5971d2274dc56ee9df469bd9dd48
or (if you have sqlite)
  ./sql report <<< "select result_checksum, date, report, build_machine_release from build where egg_linux_commit = 'e11acd885d9f5971d2274dc56ee9df469bd9dd48';"
to get a list of builds from one particular commit.
